# Code Printer
Code printer is a tool for scanning code and storing it in a docx file, written in Rust.

## Usage
Clone the repo onto your computer, then run the exe in the terminal with the following arguments:

 - Mandatory:
	 - the path to the directory. 
	 - the file type (with no .)
 - Optional:
	 - the path to save to. 

For example, to scan for rust files in a directory on macOS, run:
path/to/code_printer path/to/my/directory rs path/to/save/to

## Issues
This project is in the first version phase, so expect bugs. Feel free to open an issue with any bugs you find and suggestions to make the codebase better, as this is one of my first projects for learning Rust.
